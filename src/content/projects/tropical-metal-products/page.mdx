# Overview

Tropical Metal Products is a national roofing supplies manufacturer and distributor serving contractors, developers, and homeowners. I led a full digital transformation and go-to-market strategy, rebuilding their online presence, inbound systems, and performance infrastructure to align marketing, sales, and operations.

Over ~27 months, this work contributed to **over 2.5B JMD in revenue**, generated **2,000+ qualified inbound leads**, and established long-term, compounding demand through product-led marketing systems.

# Context & Problem

Despite being a market leader offline, Tropical Metal’s digital presence was fragmented and underperforming.

Key challenges:
- No clear digital positioning or customer journey
- Website functioned as a brochure, not a demand engine
- Sales relied heavily on outbound and relationship-driven pipelines
- Marketing activity lacked measurable KPIs and feedback loops
- Digital efforts were disconnected from inventory, manufacturing, and sales realities

The opportunity was not “better marketing,” but **a product-led GTM system** that aligned digital channels with how the business actually operated.

---

# My Role

**Digital Product & Growth Lead**, owning strategy and execution.

I worked directly with:
- General Manager
- Director
- Sales leadership
- Accounting and manufacturing teams

My scope covered:
- Product positioning and GTM strategy
- Website and UX architecture
- SEO and inbound demand systems
- Content strategy and media production
- Performance tracking and reporting
- Monthly strategy reviews and iteration
- Developed and executed **Google Ads campaigns, email marketing sequences, landing pages, and an e-commerce platform** supporting both B2B and D2C sales
- Coordinated campaigns with sales, accounting, and operations to ensure alignment and measurable impact
- Led monthly executive-level consultations with the General Manager and Director focused on long-term brand positioning, awareness, and revenue growth. These sessions reviewed performance data, customer behavior, market conditions, and operational constraints to guide iterative adjustments to messaging, campaigns, and GTM strategy

# Product & GTM Strategy

Rather than chasing short-term traffic, I defined a **long-term inbound GTM strategy** focused on high-intent demand.

Key strategic decisions:
- Position the website as a **sales enablement product**, not marketing collateral
- Target contractors and builders at decision-making moments
- Use SEO as a compounding acquisition channel
- Align messaging with real inventory, pricing behavior, and delivery constraints
- Build trust through education, clarity, and friction reduction
- Integrate paid channels (Google Ads, email marketing) with inbound SEO and content for a **full-funnel GTM system**
- Implement e-commerce infrastructure enabling direct online sales alongside contractor-focused B2B workflows

Defined and executed a GTM strategy that turned the website into a primary inbound sales and revenue channel.

# Technical & System Architecture

The digital stack was designed as a scalable growth system, not a static marketing site.

- Custom WordPress architecture optimized for SEO, conversion, and long-term extensibility  
- B2B and D2C e-commerce workflows supporting contractors, developers, and retail customers  
- Landing pages and conversion paths aligned to distinct buyer intents and sales motions  
- Integrated lead capture, segmentation, and email marketing tied to funnel stage and use case  
- Google Ads and SEO infrastructure connected directly to landing pages and performance tracking  
- Analytics and reporting dashboards measuring traffic, leads, conversion rates, and content ROI  
- Monthly performance reviews with leadership to guide iteration and GTM optimization  
- Platform designed to evolve alongside manufacturing, inventory, sales, and operational constraints

# UX, Content & Conversion Design

UX decisions were driven by **how buyers actually purchase roofing materials**, not assumptions.

Design priorities:
- Clear product categorization and use cases
- Simple, direct messaging aligned with buyer language
- Educational content addressing real contractor questions
- Conversion paths optimized for phone calls, inquiries, and quotes
- Performance-focused layouts to increase time on site and engagement

# Outcomes & Impact

Measurable results over ~27 months:
- **11–12% revenue increase year-over-year**
- **2,000+ qualified inbound leads**
- **Top SEO rankings** for high-intent roofing and construction keywords
- **Significant increases** in traffic, engagement, and time on site
- **~2.5B JMD in revenue impact**
- Marketing became a predictable, trackable growth function
- Website transitioned from cost center to revenue driver
- Paid campaigns, email sequences, landing pages, and e-commerce sales added **direct measurable revenue**
- Marketing and sales aligned to maximize ROI across B2B and D2C channels

## Revenue & Brand Impact

The GTM strategy prioritized **long-term brand equity and inbound demand**, not short-term spikes.

- During the first year, revenues declined slightly as legacy channels softened and systems were rebuilt
- In the following year, revenues increased by approximately **11–12% year-over-year**, driven by compounding SEO performance, stronger inbound demand, and improved sales alignment
- Brand recognition and awareness increased measurably through organic search visibility, content engagement, and direct inquiries

# Key Learnings

- GTM strategy must reflect operational reality, not marketing theory
- B2B buyers value clarity and trust over persuasion
- SEO is most powerful when treated as a product, not a channel
- Cross-functional alignment is a growth multiplier
- Paid campaigns, email marketing, and e-commerce must integrate with organic channels to maximize ROI
- Long-term systems outperform short-term campaigns

This project shaped how I approach **product marketing, growth, and product ops:** grounded in real constraints, real users, and real revenue.
