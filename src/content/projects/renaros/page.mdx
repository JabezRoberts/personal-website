# Overview

Renaros is a continuously developed AI-powered SaaS platform helping small business owners and freelancers operate, manage, and grow effectively. Built in public with a focus on scalable architecture and real-world workflows, it prioritizes clarity, trust, and extensibility over superficial AI demos.

---

# Problem

Small businesses and freelancers rely on fragmented tools for operations, planning, execution, and decision-making. AI tools often fail to integrate into real workflows or respect operational realities, creating friction, confusion, and adoption barriers.

---

# Solution

Renaros provides a developer-first, transparent platform that balances automation with control:

- Clear visibility into automation before execution  
- Free tier to maximize adoption  
- Paid tier with advanced AI automation and unlimited access  
- Scalable architecture for long-term product expansion

---

# My Role

**Founder, Product Owner & Lead Engineer**

- Product vision and positioning  
- System and data architecture  
- Frontend UX and interaction design  
- AI feature integration  
- Monetization and GTM design  
- Ongoing iteration and development

---

# Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Supabase with structured schema design and Row-Level Security  
- Multi-tenant system with role-based access control  
- Event logging, analytics hooks, and permission-aware services  
- Continuous development and integration workflows

---

# Product Development Approach

- Continuous development used as product discovery  
- Real implementation friction informs product decisions  
- Security and backend correctness prioritized over convenience  

<Callout type="info">
Implementation revealed critical gaps in backend logic that prompted redesigns, reinforcing system integrity and separation of concerns.
</Callout>

# Monetization & GTM Strategy

**Freemium Tier:**  
- Usage caps, limited automation, visibility into AI actions  
- Designed to maximize onboarding and trust

**Paid Tier (Planned):**  
- Unlimited usage, AI automation, priority feature access  
- Designed for power users and teams

---

# Product Marketing & Positioning

- Transparent automation platform, not black-box AI  
- Emphasizes trust, clarity, and control  
- Messaging targets technical founders, engineers, and product teams

---

# How I Think

- Adoption before monetization  
- Trust before automation  
- Visibility over opacity  
- Pricing based on value delivered, not access  
- AI as an assistant, not a decision-maker
