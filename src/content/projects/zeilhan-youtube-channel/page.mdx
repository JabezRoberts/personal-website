# Overview

I launched the **Zeilhan Systems YouTube channel** to address a recurring problem in the business world: entrepreneurs and small business owners often fail due to a lack of actionable knowledge — what to do, what not to do, how to get customers, market effectively, and make strategic decisions.  

Believing in the power of technology and content to accelerate business growth, I created educational videos covering marketing, product development, operations, and growth strategies. This work eventually led to **The Boardroom Podcast**, where I interviewed local and global business leaders, including a billionaire, Google employees (past and present), serial entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and bestselling authors.
